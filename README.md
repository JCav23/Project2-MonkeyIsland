Welcome to this project which is a text based choose your own adventure game.\n
Inspired by the Monkey Island Series of point and click adventure games developed by Lucasfilm Games.\n
Specifically this game puts you into an adventure directly inspired by events from the first entry 'The Secret of Monkey Island'.\n
The player takes on the role of Guybrush Threepwood a young man who dreams of becoming a great pirate.\n
During the adventure the player finds themselves on a ship sailing to Monkey Island and must solve puzzles to progress\n
This project aims to mimic these events instructing the player to find the correct items to win the game.\n
The items chosen are similar to those found within the original adventure as seen below in an image taken from the game.\n

This is the Code Institute student template for deploying your third portfolio project, the Python command-line project. The last update to this file was: **August 17, 2021**

## Reminders

* Your code must be placed in the `run.py` file
* Your dependencies must be placed in the `requirements.txt` file
* Do not edit any of the other files or your code may not deploy properly

## Creating the Heroku app

When you create the app, you will need to add two buildpacks from the _Settings_ tab. The ordering is as follows:

1. `heroku/python`
2. `heroku/nodejs`

You must then create a _Config Var_ called `PORT`. Set this to `8000`

If you have credentials, such as in the Love Sandwiches project, you must create another _Config Var_ called `CREDS` and paste the JSON into the value field.

Connect your GitHub repository and deploy as normal.

## Constraints

The deployment terminal is set to 80 columns by 24 rows. That means that each line of text needs to be 80 characters or less otherwise it will be wrapped onto a second line.

Happy coding!
